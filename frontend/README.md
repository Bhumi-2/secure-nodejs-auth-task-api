# Frontend – Bajarangs Backend Developer Assignment

This is a very simple **Vanilla JS** frontend to demonstrate:
- User registration
- Login
- JWT-based access to a protected dashboard
- CRUD operations on Tasks

## ▶️ Usage

1. Start the backend first (see `../backend/README.md`).
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser (you can simply double-click it).
3. Use the **Register** form, then the **Login** form.
4. Once logged in, the token will appear in the "Current Token" box.
5. Use the **Dashboard – Tasks** section to create and view tasks.

If your backend runs on a different host/port, update `API_BASE` in `frontend/app.js`.
